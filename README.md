# etch-a-sketch

Etch-A-Sketch project from the Odin Project curriculum

This is a project fromt the Odin Project curriculum to put to use understanding of html, css, javascript and most importantly DOM tree manipulation.

Updating on Tuesday, February 21, 2023: This is a working etch-a-sketch program following the TOP assignment! These are the bare minimum requirements... I will be revisiting this to put in a greyscale function, a slider bar to determine the grid size, make the layout something more attractive, and clean up and refactor all my code that I've written here. This has been an exciting and informative process - I'm happy with my results!
